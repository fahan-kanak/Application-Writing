# Application-Writing

This is a desktop app written in Java using the Swing framework. Using this app, a student can send an application to a teacher by e-mail. First, a student has to select a template from the given four templates in the drop down box after the Application type label. Then after filling up the form, the student needs to select the destination and click the Submit button. Then the window will be closed and the application will be sent to the particular destination or teacher. And if the Create button is clicked, then only the application will be created at the folder where the program is located, it will not go to the destination. As at the destination our teachers e-mail ids are used, so it is requested to whoever downloads and runs the app not to click the Submit button.
